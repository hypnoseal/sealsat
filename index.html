        <h1 id="requirement">Requirement</h1>
        <p>Rapid economic expansion, project development and climate change means an ever increasing need for improved data, voice and video communications in Canada's North.  This requires the roll-out of a vast and interconnected network available across the North.  Current network provision is accomplished through geostationary satellite infrastructure, which provides poor coverage for high latitudes.</p>
        <p>Multiple parties are attempting to alleviate the North's bandwidth shortage through varying technologies; ranging from satellite, microwave to fibre optic delivery systems.  Most of the proposed options provide limited coverage for areas with low population density or are prohibitively expensive.  Northern government and private industry leaders need a solution which provides a cost effective method of delivering connectivity to the entirety of the Arctic.</p>
        <p>The North requires network infrastructure which enables access at affordable rates with consistent performance metrics irregardless of the locality.</p>

        <h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
        <p>Satellite based infrastructure is, in general, the most cost effective method of delivering connectivity in remote regions.  This is due to the ability of satellite providers to shift a large portion of the sunk construction costs to cheaper jurisdictions.  Satellites themselves, their associated infrastructure and network operations can be built and developed in more cost effective environments.  Unlike land based infrastructure, such as cable or microwave, the construction costs in remote areas for a satellite solution is limited to the rollout of earth stations and metropolitan area networks (MAN).  These costs savings allow for: cheaper solutions which provide an ability for the frequent overhaul or enhancement of network hardware; a shift from the costs associated with the construction of cables or towers to improved satellite functionality and capabilities; and, vastly greater coverage.</p>

        <p>A satellite solution, as compared to a land based solution, provides additional benefits such as lower environmental impact and greater functionality.</p>
